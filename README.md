# VidStitch - App

TODO: short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

### Current progess
Hits the backend and retrieves a 'Hello World!'

## Architecture

We used the react-native starter-kit from the extra credit short assignment. For making api requests, we used react-native's Fetch API.

### Concept
This is a real-time video editing and sharing application. The editing and viewing is done on a mobile device. The splicing, storing, and returning of the videos, users, and posts is done on a backend server.

### Mockups

### Components
![architecture diagram](img/architecture.png)

The project consists of several related components:

#### React-Native App
The mobile application is built on React Native. It will handle the user-facing functionality including registering, editing, posting, and commenting on friend's posts. The video editing will be done in-app using [React-Native Video](https://github.com/shahen94/react-native-video-processing) Processing. The navigation between components will be built on React Native, and the `FETCH/POST` calls will be handled with various React libraries such as Axios.

#### Flask Server
The backend relies on a Flask server, and uses various python libraries for stitching and properly formatting the videos into a single video object to be stored in the Amazon S3 cloud. This server will handle the user registration, friending logic, as well as manage the `FETCH/POST` calls from the app.

#### Amazon S3 Server
The final cut, completely processed video objects will be stored in the Amazon S3 cloud. The S3 server will be able to handle `FETCH/POST` calls to video objects.

## Setup
### Global installs
You will need an http://expo.io account if you do not already have one. 

`brew install node` 

`brew install watchman`

`npm install -g exp`

### Environment setup
Be sure to run `yarn` to install all dependencies, and install the latest version of xcode.

Make sure you have the API running, then run `exp start` to get the main app compiled. 

You're welcome to view the app however you like, but for simplicity's sake we're testing with `exp ios`, which you should run in a separate terminal tab. If you restart the simulator, make sure to Cmd+Q the actual simulator from your desktop before attempting to reload it.
